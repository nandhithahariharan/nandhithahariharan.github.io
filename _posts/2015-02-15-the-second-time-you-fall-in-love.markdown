# THE SECOND TIME YOU FALL IN&nbsp;LOVE.

“Because love is not instagram to always show you in the best possible light. It is messy and ugly like the unfiltered snap chats you send your best friend”
_**

**The first thing you should know about the second time you fall in love is that it will be very different.** 

**The first time you fell in love**, you were innocent, untouched and hopelessly optimistic. When you got your heart broken, you decided that you would never fall in love again. **You now know that “forever” is a gamble and that “promises” are more often than not made to be broken.**

**The second time you fall in love, your heart will beat a little faster.** There is bubbling apprehension, restless guilt, unmasked fear, unresolved emotions and all of this is still delicately laced with the most basic need to be loved.

**You will surprise yourself because the day you believed will never come, has finally arrived.** 

It is not easy to let someone else in. It was effortless the first time because love just gilded into a place which you never knew existed. **Now it just feels like you are pushing someone else out to let another one in and killing yourself in the process.**

Second love could be more voluntary and less vivid because you are determined to not let your emotions get the better of you. **First love may have taught you how to love and fly, but second love will help you unlearn and humble you in a very earthy way.** 

**Second first times are always complicated.** First dates are not first dates in the real sense, but they are first dates nevertheless.You are torn in between the butterflies in your stomach moment when you are getting to know someone new while at the same time missing the comfort of eating out of a jar in your night clothes

**The second time you fall in love, you foolishly try to surpass imperceptible benchmarks.** You remember that his forehead didn’t crinkle like that. He used to hold hands a lot more. He never wore bright colors.

**Remind yourself that it will never be the same. And it most certainly should not be. You are trying to find love, not a replacement.** 

The second time you fall in love, you will hear a voice in your head that repeatedly asks you to “**RUN”.**

It is natural because we are taught to survive based on acquired learning. **Even a child knows not to play with fire twice.** 

**The second time you fall in love, no matter how hard it tries to sweep you off your feet, you will be adamant to keep your feet on the ground.** You are passionate about how much love can give but scared stiff of how much it can take back when it wants to.

**The second time you fall in love it might be more accepting and selfless. Second love wants to write pages and pages of your life together but it lacks the ugly selfishness of first love which expects the whole book to be about it.**You deal with the fact that everyone has songs that remind them of someone else and places where they made some unblemished memories.

You know that poets lied when they said that every kiss will be like your first kiss. **You are mature enough to accept that burning lust always comes with an expiry date.** 

Second love is difficult. Tearing down the walls that you built around yourself is not easy when you constantly question the effort involved. When you eventually find someone who is willing to **accept the mess that you are**, don’t be afraid.

**Fall in love for the second time. Life mostly begins here.**
