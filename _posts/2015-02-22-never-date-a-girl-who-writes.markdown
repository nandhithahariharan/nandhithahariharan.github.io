It could be in a quaint cafe, a breezy afternoon at the beach or right in the middle of nowhere. You will spot a girl with wrinkled clothes, loosely tied up hair and an air of indifference. **She is oblivious to the fact that her coffee is getting cold as she furiously types away.** 

And if you ever meet such a girl, there is just one thing that I can tell you.

**Run**.

**Never date a girl who writes.**

Never date a girl who writes because she does not have the knack to spot the line that divides reality from fantasy. She exists in a state of rapture persistently trying to fathom which is what. Never date a girl who writes because she falls in love very easily.  **She is not in love with you as much as she is in love with the very idea of “falling in love”.**

****She will love you with passion, let you inspire her and even write about you.  She will kiss you in a way that it seems like it is right out of a third-rate best seller but write about you with such eloquence that it could as well be the next greatest literature.

**As you lose yourself in this dream, remember that she knows best that every good story must come to an end.** 

**Never date a girl who writes because she will always write about you, the good, the bad and the downright ugly.** You will be her hero, her villain, her muse and you will wonder if you could mean so much to anyone else.  She just cannot grasp emotions that have not been spoken in a voice familiar to her. **And that voice, more often than not, is words.** 

Never date a girl who writes because she is not as resilient as her words**. It will frustrate you because it seems like she is emotionally available only to her journal.**

**There may be layers of fear and insecurity hiding behind the shrewdest of her words. Sit her down and hold her close to you. She may tell you the stories behind her stories, but I cannot promise that the writer won’t take over mid-way!** 

Never date a girl who writes because her greatest gift and not weakness lies in how susceptible she is to the world around her. She is vulnerable and not weak because **she has mastered the art of conquering through surrender.**

She will intimidate you with blind trust, partly because she knows that you will never break her heart **but mostly because she knows that there is nothing more inspiring than pain.** Nothing and not even heartbreak can scare her as much as **not finding her next story.** 

**Never date a girl who writes because it just won’t be the same again when you date a girl who does not write.**

She may never forget what you said but she is quick to forgive as good stories come from imperfections. You will miss her simplicity and the way just a book or a letter can become the most perfect gifts for her. **Even a copy of a book she already owns is enough to make her smile.**

Never date a girl who writes because **they have this rare ability to make any other kind of commitment and devotion pale in comparison to theirs!**

**But, date a girl who writes. No one else****can hold your hands, move you through the smallest of gestures and show you infinite possibilities that this lifetime could bring, just through words.**

**And if you think that your love can be the one thing that leaves her searching for words, then, definitely date a girl who writes!**
