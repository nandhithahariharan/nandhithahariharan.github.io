When it was time to go home I searched for my shoes under your bed.  I frowned a little when I knew that we had not exchanged numbers.

I always thought that we would connect in a conventional place. Like a music store or in between a dusty bookshelf where we both picked something we liked.

I am a clichéd girl like that which is why we hooked up at a **crowded bar where you drown in a sea of sweaty people losing themselves to loud music.**

Your eyes met mine after a couple of drinks, but you had no idea that you had caught my eye much earlier.

We both knew that having just “one” more drink is never a good idea.

The dream was to live the night and only the night for as long as it lasts. **Breakfast was never part of the plan.** 

The dream would have been perfect if it wasn’t you because I was already a little smitten. **And also, there is no way I can avoid you in the familiar corridors that we tread every day.** 

With you, it should have started with a cup of coffee where we would have politely exchanged irrelevant details about our lives.  I should have ideally had to spend a few weeks pretending to be interested in whatever you were saying even if you were talking about random sci-fi movies. I should have had time to Google all those things you say about music and movies before our second date

However, thank you very much for fast-forwarding these conventional parts because I have to say that I enjoyed getting love bites when I was trying to recollect your last name.

**I didn’t exactly expect us to have a conversation about Paulo Coelho before we had our first kiss, but it may have been nicer if you had known how to spell my name the day after.**

If we had gone on that second date like most couples do, I am sure we would have hit it off. Although there is no rigid timeline, I would have started asking you polite questions about your past for which you would have replied with tact or the unabashed candor of a man falling in love.

But all I did was lay next to you in bed the night you took me home and wonder how many women you have known. I wanted to believe you when you said “You are special and I don’t really do this”.

**And more than that, I wanted you to believe me when I said the same. But, who are we kidding?  There is a reason why I returned your shirt the next morning. It is for the same reason I left behind a tinge of my perfume and a piece of my inexpensive jewelry in your apartment.** 

It may have not been my proudest night, but I would be lying if I said that it wasn’t fun.

I liked how I could taste just a little bit of the whiskey you had and the usually repulsive smell of smoke fit in just well with the rest of you.  I liked what little I could see of your eyes and smile. I liked the passion and I liked the indifference with which you checked mail, right after.

I liked that we were able to crack a few jokes the next morning and even talk about the weather. In between the few jokes, I wanted to ask you if there was someone else, but I didn’t because feeling like you belong is not part of the package.

**You walked me home, which was pretty nice, but when you mumbled a small “I’ll call you tomorrow”, I knew better.** 

I wondered the day after if it is strange to add someone on Facebook just after you spent the night with them.   I guess it is strange, especially when you don’t know how to spell their name.

I like the cold resilience with which we can manage a diplomatic smile on the occasions that we do run into each other.  I like that you will always be a favorite chapter in my book which I cannot re-read no matter how badly I want to.

But, I don’t have to re-read because I already know the words by-heart.

**I like that our story will always be about the possibility of what could have been. I like that you will always be the one night stand that I fell for, just a little bit.**

And if you read this sometime, go accept that friend request.

**Maybe we can finish the rest of the story later.**
