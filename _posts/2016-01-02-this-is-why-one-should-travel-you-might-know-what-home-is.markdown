# This Is Why One Should Travel: You Might Know, What Home&nbsp;Is

				

			



						


		


			



		


**Travel.**


**Travel because cupcakes don’t taste the same everywhere**. The taste of roasted pork or chicken with lemon grass. Peanut butter shakes that freeze in your palms and donuts that melt in your mouth.The fragrance of jasmine rice topped with a beautiful green curry. Sample the best dumplings in the world and still miss home a little bit.

**Travel.**






**Travel because that is the one way you will learn a million things about this world only to unlearn it all the very next time you go to another place**.





You will catch the resilient woman you never know existed within you when you lose yourself in a swarming market. **Say hello to the vulnerable girl inside you when the slightest scent of something that smells like home brings a drop of tear to your eyes.**

















**Travel.**

Travel because that is one way you will meet people from all over the world. **Be surprised at the way how one language can sound so different when spoken by different people and how one thought can be like the light that enters a prism and instead comes out as a rainbow of perceptions!**

Travel.

Travel because beer tastes much better when sipped a few thousand miles away from your local watering hole. Talk to a girl from some other part of the world over a beer and a cigarette if you like and realize that despite never having met each other before, **you both like fashion and Jane Austen.**

**Travel.**

Travel because that is the only way you will grasp how different we all are. Meet people from all over the world and give yourself a chance to smile over the same things. And if possible, **give yourself a chance to cry over the same things because that is when you realize we are all essentially the same.**


**Travel.**

Travel because when everyone you know at home tells you that the darkness is too much to bear, **you can tell them that there is still sunshine left in the world.**

**Travel.**

Whether it is holding a piece of paper so carefully in your bag because it is all that there is to validate your identity or falling in love with a boy you know you cannot have, **travel makes you a little more human with a stroke of vulnerability.**


&nbsp;

**Travel**

Travel because you need to know that cupcakes don’t taste the same everywhere.

But when you do taste cupcakes in any corner of the world and let the sugar melt in your mouth just the way you would back at home, **you would know that it really is just one small world after all.**

**Travel**.

Because that is the only way you will realize that every place can be home if only you let it be.
