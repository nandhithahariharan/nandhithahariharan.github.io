Show me a girl who refuses to stay backstage. It does not matter if you call her a “know it all&#8221;.She will occasionally wear the hat of a cheer-leader and for the rest of the times she will be the coach who drives you to the finish line.

Show me a girl who does not feel the need to look at every mirror she sees.  She is the girl who knows that there is nothing uglier than always talking about one’s weight/body. Show me a girl who doesn’t need makeup to feel beautiful. She is the girl who can go out with just a smile on her lips.

Show me a girl who is in control of her emotions. She is the girl who can laugh loudly in public without the fear of being labeled crass. She is the girl who can express her emotions without bordering on drama-queen.

Show me a girl who is strong. She is the girl who knows that tears are neither a weapon nor a sign of weakness. She is the girl who loves being a girl but also knows that it has nothing to do with being delicate.

Show me a girl who understands that people make mistakes.  She is the girl who can be happy when she is sad. She is the girl who chooses to believe when it is over for the rest of the world. She is the girl who is quick when it comes to forgiving others and faster when it comes to forgiving herself.

Show me a girl who is in control of her emotions, but not all the time.  She is the girl who lets the tequila take over her without resistance. She lets alcohol and music flow through her body as she dances to the tunes of freedom.

Show me a girl who can pull off model with flabby arms, classy with stilettos and red lips, and intellectual with a short skirt.  She is the girl who grew up after high school. She is the girl who does not believe in labels and mocks at judgments.

Show me a girl who intimidates you. She is the girl who keeps the cocktail menu aside before ordering a round of scotch, on the rocks.

Show me a girl who does not finish every book she starts because she knows when to move on.

Show me a girl who opens the door for her man and takes him out on a date. She is the girl who does not make fun of a man who sheds a few tears or a woman who does not like to cry. She loves people, not genders, or the roles they are supposed to play!

Show me a girl who does not always fit in. While most people are trying to stand out from the crowd, she is the one trying hard to be part of the crowd.

And finally, Show me a girl, who in a way wants to belong somewhere. And if you show me such a girl, odds are she will either be you or I.
