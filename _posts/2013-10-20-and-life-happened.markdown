# And, Life Happened!

				

			


						


		


			



		



Just a year ago, for a few of us there were good things in store and for a few just unreasonable expectations to shoulder. It seemed improbable that we would be happy in a place that was not school.  Amidst waiting for my results, filling up application forms and moving forward with life there was still a part of me that was not sure about what was happening.

****It is unlikely that a year has rolled by so quickly and I am still not quite sure about what has happened. Of course, apart from a few dreams being mellowed by reality and understanding that college brochures are somewhat like our photo shopped profile pictures, nothing much has changed.

They say our maturity is always a step below the experiences we encounter. I remember walking into college on the first day thinking that this was the worst thing that was happening to me. Unless you are the lucky few who fell in love with college on the first day I am sure most of you thought that you were “too cool” for the college. Everything was new, seemed ridiculous and it felt like I was never going to get used to it.  And for the first time in my life I sat in a classroom filled with girls and I thought “my life is officially over!”

If you think I am going to tell you how my opinion about college changed completely after really exciting things happened to me, you are wrong. The truth is, college has eventually become a part of life. I realized that the things I worried so much about are no longer a priority. I have met my fair share of amazing friends at college who keep life going. A few months into college and you already know how to get around the policies and rules and if not you have a group of friends who will get into trouble with you! As time passes by we all eventually spot the silver lining. And your semester results will definitely help with the “too cool” attitude!

This is the time when people tell anybody who has given their board examinations that this exam is life defining. If success ratio was as sleek as the number of people who made it to great universities, the world would be a sad place to live in.  The only thing anybody in this phase has to remember is that you are running this race with yourself. There are no wrong answers. You just have to ask yourself the right questions!  

If everything goes as planned, then it’s time to celebrate and if everything doesn’t, just go on with life convincing yourself that the world will end this December. And who knows, by then things might get better and  you might agree with me when I say “Life Happened!”.
