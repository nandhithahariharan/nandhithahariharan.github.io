**He can’t possibly break my heart**. Staring at uninterrupted nothings and smiling, just because.

Sweet-nothings, pounding anticipation and impulsive blushes. Waking up to a text from you and sleeping to the sound of your voice. Racing heartbeats and occasional hand-holding**. I am going to pretend that I like superhero movies.** 

**I love being around you, the way your fresh scent reminds me of something so strikingly familiar.** 

I love the way you kiss me, I love the way I think it will be when you kiss me and I love your dimples**. I would change nothing about you.**

I am going to laugh at all your silly jokes**. I like your friends**. I am totally fine if you want to hang out with your friends today. It is okay that you have not heard of Ayn Rand.

**I love the tea you make. It doesn’t matter that I like it with milk and extra sugar**. It is cute when you get angry. It is adorable how indecisive you are. You can pick the movie.

It&#8217;s almost been an hour since we spoke. Something must be wrong.Is that too clingy? Or, should I care more?

Thai-food over my usually greasy and comfortable burger and fries? I love trying new things. I want to keep talking to you for the rest of the night. **You hang up. No, you hang up.**

Stolen glances thrown your way and my weeks planned around our dates.I am going to stay up until you text me. And then, I am going to stay up as long as you text me.

**I feel so awake, I barely slept last night.****I can’t stop talking to you. And then, I can’t stop talking about you.** 

I don’t know how long your love is going to make me spin like a little girl on a tea-cup ride.

**But, until then, I am staring at uninterrupted nothings and smiling, just because.**

**Just because, it is the Honeymoon Phase!**
