I remember a little framed quote that I always used to keep at my desk. It read “If your heart was really broken, you would die.”

It was a constant reminder to my no-nonsense cynical self that **a heartbreak was not that painful**. Heartbroken to me was nothing but a **theatrical misconception that a stoned poet conjured.**

How can someone “break” your heart? It had no physical connotation what-so-ever. At least, that is what I thought.

So, when do you realize that a heart-break is very real?

**What does it take to realize that a “heart-break” actually has a very tangible physical connotation to it?**

It takes waking up one morning, suddenly stripped off your denial and realizing that your life has changed a great deal.

**It takes coming to terms with the fact that your house will smell of yesterday’s breakfast and that you are going to smell of freshly dried tears for a while.**

It takes sleeping with frizzy hair and puffed eyes in your old clothes that were supposed to be in the washing machine, a week ago.

It takes a sink full of undone dishes, untouched homework and a heavy heart.

**It takes waking up to the smell of Nutella and banana pancakes and grasping that you still don’t have an appetite.**

What does it take to realize that a “heart-break” actually means that you are broken?

You slowly start to realize that you don’t make plans for “We”.

You realize that suddenly you have **no one to tell the most unimportant details of your life to**. You smile when someone says how being single feels great even though every time you think about the fact that you are single, it feels like someone **just punched you in the gut**.

It is normal to panic at the very sight of emptiness. **When an important person leaves our life, it creates a void. We hate emptiness and we immediately fill that void with something, no matter how meaningless it might be.**

That is why he becomes a box of chocolates. He becomes a new hair-cut. He becomes a new job, a new city.  He becomes a gold fish you cannot take care of.  He becomes a new hobby or a garden.

**He becomes a box of condoms in your rebound phase.**

And slowly, he becomes everything that you try to thrust in to fill the void that he left behind.

What does it take to realize that a “heart-break” takes its own time to heal?

It takes days when you are smiling because it seems like there is finally a new beginning.  That feeling lasts only until memories of a seemingly sweeter yesterday pushes you back to the corner of your bed where **you cannot even stand the thought of your own blanket touching you**.

It takes days when you feel that life is downright unfair. It takes days when you plead with **destiny to give you just another first time with the familiar.** It takes sleepless nights and days when you just live to oversleep.

And then it takes those most important days. The worst days. The days when somewhere in between a busy meeting, an excel file, a meaningful book, a funny movie or just before you drink a sip of water on a random afternoon, **you wonder**.

You wonder, however did I let something so perfect be ruined?

**And it is on those days that you realize that a heart-break is very real after all.**
