# And What The Vows Should Say..&nbsp;!

				

			



						


		


			



		



Till death do us part. Or, maybe not.

Wedding vows if you ask me, need not be about forevers.

Promise to make each other’s sandwich with extra mayonnaise and never be stingy when it comes to love or chocolate spread. Promise to know by-heart how many spoons of sugar they like to take with their coffee and **never forget the little ketchup packet that comes with the fries**.

Promise to keep the ugly photographs only in your phone and like every picture, every post, every tweet and every comment, just because. Promise not to stalk their exes and promise to let the past lay where it belongs. **Promise to Wi-Fi proof your bedroom** and never to let a smart phone creep inside your blanket when you are with them. **Promise to live a little.**

Promise to never let the world end with you two.  Let the beaches of Bali take your breath away, get lost in the markets of Hong Kong, get intimidated by the sky-scrapers in New York and gasp at the beauty of nature in places that you go to. Cuddle next to each other in the strangest of places and **feel at home even when you are so far away from home. Promise to travel**.

Promise to be their spell-check, alarm clock, tax planner, recipe tester, coach and whatever else they need you to be. **Wake them up on those days when they really want to sleep**, ask them to sleep when they are stretching too far, push them when they are slacking and sit next to them silently when they want to think aloud. **Promise to keep each other’s dreams alive**.

Promise to **never tell them they look “ugly”** in a dress. If at all they look ugly, promise that the dress would just mysteriously disappear from their wardrobe but they would never have to hear the word “ugly!” Promise to be the **spring they need in autumn** and promise to be their **summer when it is snowing outside.**

Promise to **never flirt with anyone they know** and promise that you will not stare at anyone else for too long when they are next to you. Promise to **try and make them jealous but promise to never make them insecure**. Never forget that you don’t “own” each other and never take offense when they want to be left alone for a while. **Promise to be loyal but promise to let them breathe.**

Promise to **make love to them until the stars can melt in your palms** and promise that it won’t always be this cheesy. Promise to never frown at each other’s fantasies and **promise make-up sex after every bad fight**. Promise handcuffs, candlelight, strawberries and like I already said, promise to never be stingy with the chocolate spread. **Promise to never be a prude.**

Promise to look out for them. Remember to **pack an extra tooth-brush** and save their favourite top even when they throw it away. Apologize when you are wrong and promise **never to believe the things that they say when they are angry. Promise to always think for two.**

Promise to be around in health and sickness and most importantly promise to **never let them hear the words “I told you so!”** Promise to love them when you want to hate them because that is when they need it the most.

**Promise to remember that promises cannot always be kept and promise to love them anyway.**

**Promise to forgive.**

And if you can promise them all this, **no matter how long, they would have found a forever within you.**
