# A Letter To My Daughter On&nbsp;Heartbreaks,

				

			



						


		


			



		


&nbsp;


&nbsp;

The first time you complained a little too much about the boy who made fun of your braces and at the same time took a few minutes longer to get ready to school, I knew that you were smitten. I don’t think either of us remember his name right now. And that is precisely what I want you to recall every time a boy breaks your heart. **This too shall pass.** 

The first time you fell off a bicycle, you didn’t break into dramatic tears. You brushed the dust off your knees and marched on because you all you wanted to do was ride a cycle. And I wish you can look at life like that. **There is an adventure around every corner.**

I have always treated you like a woman who knew what she was doing but I have always looked at you as a little girl with pigtails. I knew you were too young for your first day at school. I knew you were too young for your first sleepover. I knew you were too young for your first lipstick. I knew you were too young for your first drink. **And to me, you will always be too young for a heartbreak**.

Trust me, despite your denials and fake enthusiasm, I know when you are broken. I know from the way your spoon makes circles on a plate that is filled with your favorite dish. I know from the way you rush back to your room every time I bring up his name.

It doesn’t matter if you  say “No, I was not crying”. **Remember, my job was to understand you even before you started speaking?**

I want to tell you so much about love, life and boys, but I know that you are going to roll your eyes at the uncool mom and call the best friend. **I wish I could tell you that she gives really stupid advice but we both know that would mean war.**

As much as I want to protect you from storms, I know that you are a rainbow that shines amidst dark clouds.  **I know that you need to see the world, but more than that, the world needs to see a star like you.** 

I will tell you that heartbreaks make you grow. I will lie to you when I tell you that you won’t even remember his name in a few years but I sure as hell will mean it when I say that **he didn’t deserve you in the first place**.

You will brush me off and not believe these words for a very long time, but the day will come when you finally realize that your mother was right. **And on that day, you will call me and ask me where I got all the calm and wise from.**

And that is the day I will let you in on my secret. The day when I know that you have healed enough to listen to this from me and laugh.

I only stayed calm because you were huddled in my lap, exhausted from all the crying.

**But believe me when I say that it was not just daddy, but also mommy who really wanted to kick his ass.**
